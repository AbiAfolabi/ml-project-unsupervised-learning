# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.
### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes
### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked."


## Process

1. Import required libraries

2. Read csv file into a dataframe
 
3. Performed EDA & Pre-processing 

- visuaizing data with different charts
- log transformation of skewed numerical columns
- scaling prior to feeding into the model

4. Carried out K-Means Clustering

- I dentified optimum number of clusters using Elbow rule
- created model and fitted it to the data
- plot clusters

5. Hierarchical Clustering

6. Dimesionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)



## Results

1. The dataset is asymmetrical and right skewed. Correlations amongst the features varies. There are strong positive as well as negative correlations.

3. Most sales are from Region 3. Purchases from channel 1 is ~double of channel 2.

3. The clustering in this dataset is not distinct. There are areas of overlap and the inter-cluster distance is low.

4. All the six numerical features can be reduced to 2 or 3 components that will be representative of the features
